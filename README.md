# Game of Life UI

This project consists of a graphical user interface (UI) for Conway's Game of Life. It is developed using PySide2, a Python binding for the Qt framework.

## Features

- Display of a cell grid representing the game board.
- Buttons to clear the grid, fill it randomly, start/stop automatic progression, and manually advance to the next turn.
- Ability to click on cells to toggle their state (alive/dead).

## Usage

`python app.py`

This will launch the graphical user interface where you can interact with the game board.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.9
- PySide2

You can install PySide2 using pip:

`pip install PySide2`
